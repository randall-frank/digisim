Overview
--------
This is an old board game written back in 1986 for the Apple II.  Patterned after
chess and an old physical board game of the same name, the idea is to place
a collection of reflective panels, beam splitters and light-pipes to protect
your four 'key' blocks.  On each turn one can move one piece any number of 
unblocked squares north, south, east or west and then rotate the piece.
Alternatively, a player may opt to move and fire a laser from the back row.
If a laser hits a piece from an unprotected direction, the piece is destroyed.
Play continues back and forth until one player has lost all of their 'key'
blocks.

In 2024, the original source code to the game was unearthed and the original
programmer decided to fix up the project enough so that it was playable again.
The resulting source code is in this repo and one can download a generated
disk image from itch.io.

Details
-------
The game is written entirely in Merlin 6502 assembly.

There is a build script in this repo that is capable of generating a .2mg file 
from the sources.  It requires several tools to be installed:

- Python
- `Merlin32 Assembler <https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/>`_
- `CiderPress II <https://ciderpress2.com/>`_

If one places the CiderPress CLI in a subdirectory named 'ciderpress' (ciderpress/cp2.exe)
and places the Merlin package in a subdirectory named 'merlin32' 
(merlin32\\Windows\\Merlin32.exe), then the following commands will build
the `deflection.2mg` file:

.. code::

   python -m virtualenv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
   python build.py


One can adjust the pathnames to CiderPress and Merlin at the top of the build.py file.
